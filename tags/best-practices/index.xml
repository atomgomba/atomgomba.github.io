      <description>When adding a new property to an existing data class, the compiler can warn us when we forget to initialize its value somewhere in the codebase. But it can only help if the new property does not have a default value: without the help from the compiler, it is very easy to miss an unset value, particularly in large code bases! Going through all the places where the property is used also gives us a valuable chance to revisit the business logic and think about why and where it is used.</description>

      <description>When I&amp;rsquo;m bumping into an interface with only one implementation, it makes me think of reasons why is that interface even needed?
Common arguments Interfaces are good for many things: promote code re-use by abstraction, help define boundaries in architecture, provide a form of multiple inheritance and so on, but usually a common argument for using them is that they make it easy to swap implementations, thus they also help with testing.</description>
